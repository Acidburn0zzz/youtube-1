in this episode we improve the [i3ipc-python] script we created in
[03-listening] by applying some of the techniques used in another video 
([HOW TO SET ALL WINDOWS FLOATING IN I3WM]), where i demo the script:  
https://github.com/acrisci/i3ipc-python/blob/master/examples/floating-mode.py

we also take a look on how to use `print()` in python to output stuff.
